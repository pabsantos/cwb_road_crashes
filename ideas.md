# Ideas for a paper

## Idea 1
- **Outcome variable**: Road traffic deaths of pedestrians and cyclists.
	- Per 100.000 inhabitants
- **Environment variables**
	- Land use: 
		- classification between residential, industrial and commercial;
		- Land use mix
	- Traffic and road network:
		- Quantity of intersections;
		- Bus stops; 
		- "Ciclovias";
		- Traffic lights;
		- Road type (Curitiba's classification - % per type and mix)
	- Demographics:
		- Pop. density
		- Income

## Idea 2
- Make a clustering of the road traffic deaths of pedestrians and cyclists (using TAZs or census tracts)
	- _question: Are road traffic deaths of pedestrians and cyclists spatial dependent?_ 
- Identify high-high clusters and low-low clusters
	- _question: If so, where?_
- Compare characteristics of these clusters (land use, pop. density, income, road type, ...)
	- _question: What are the characteristics of these clusters?_
